# NG+ Roleplay Classes
This was based on [/u/Leesinmain1992](https://old.reddit.com/user/Leesinmain1992) [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/u90gap/fun_thematic_and_viable_buildpaths_for_your_fresh/) , on the Elden Ring subreddit and since i needed a project to study React and MongoDB, i've took the MERN tutorial from MongoDB and adapted into this project, there's still a lot of things to do which i'm still working on. This is a very early Alpha State, its functional, there's no option to edit since there's user control yet!

# To do list
Priority:
> User control
> Sort by latest entry
> Edit page

Later on:
> Better visual and standardization for the images
> Rewrite the tutorial code to something more professional

# NPM packages
> npm mongodb express cors dotenv
